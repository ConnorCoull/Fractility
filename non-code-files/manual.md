# User manual 

As per the requirements, this software is designed to be easy to use. If accessing from `fractility.connorcoull.dev`, simply click the button on the top left to switch between Rust and JavaScript, adjust the parameters in the left "Options" panel to your desire, notice how the time is reflected in the top right corner. Finally, when you have a fractal you like the download button at the bottom of the options panel will save your fractal as a .png in your Downloads folder.

If running the application locally, use `serve.sh` on linux or `serve.bat` on Windows, `ctrl` + click to access the localhost, and see above.
