Bug 🐛 - Interdependancy between VUE components 
Solution - forgot to import init() from wasm file, hence crashing without helloworld.

Bug 🐛 - Fractals generate weirdly
Solution - JavaScript was subtracting as ints, but adding as strings

Bug 🐛 - The length scalar is incorrect
Solution - switched it to range from 0-2 and have 0.1 steps. Originally I had it range 0-200 and divided it by 100,
the switch to 0-2 but still being divided by 100 and starting at 50 caused the bug.

Bug 🐛 - the coords system isn't like what i need

Bug 🐛- Reloading when dev console is open changes the scaling (make responsive!!)
Solution - resizing the window causes the canvas to be redrawn, which causes the scaling to be reset. Same for phones.
Not a part of the specifcation, but it would be nice to have it be responsive.

Bug 🐛 - There is a margin that won't go away, despite all padding and margins set to 0


Bug 🐛 - The scalings don't work, but the other settings do
Solution - scalars had an "x_scalar" name, but were being called as "x scalar"

Bug 🐛 - Maximum Call Stack Size Exceeded
Solution - Once again there was an issue in the Rust code at runtime, which caused that error due to bad code.

Bug 🐛 - Width wasn't snapping to 0.1 values, only whole ints
Solution - I didn't include a step in the component declaration

Bug 🐛 - The canvas doesn't function normally on larger screens
